# Contributing to XEQUES

XEQUES is a research-first protocol.

## Guidelines
- Do not modify RFC-0001 (frozen)
- New ideas require a new RFC
- Code changes must reference a protocol section
- Cryptographic changes require justification

By contributing, you agree to keep XEQUES reviewable,
minimal, and execution-focused.
