# XEQUES — Quantum-Resilient Command Finality Layer

XEQUES defines a Layer-1 primitive: **cryptographically verifiable execution receipts** (Proof-of-Command-Correctness, PoCC).
This repo holds research material plus a minimal, self-contained demo for publication.

## What this repo contains
- `paper/` — short research memo + architecture (Mermaid)
- `publish_clean/` — a self-contained minimal Rust demo project that compiles
- `README.md` — this document

## Vision
Post-quantum secure identity and command authentication for autonomous infrastructure:
satellites, drones, power grids, AV fleets, industrial robotics.

## Quick start (publish snapshot)
1. cd publish_clean
2. cargo run
