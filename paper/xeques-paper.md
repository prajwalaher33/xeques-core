## Abstract

Autonomous systems increasingly operate beyond continuous human supervision, in environments where connectivity is intermittent, latency is high, and system lifetimes span decades. While modern cryptographic systems can authenticate *who issued a command*, they do not provide cryptographic proof that a command was *actually executed correctly* by the target system.

This paper introduces **XEQUES**, a Layer-1 protocol centered on a new trust primitive called **Proof-of-Command-Correctness (PoCC)**. In XEQUES, the unit of trust is not authorization, consensus, or ordering, but **execution itself**. Devices emit post-quantum-secure, cryptographically verifiable execution receipts after performing authorized commands. These receipts can be verified offline, audited independently, and chained into immutable execution histories.

XEQUES is designed for long-lived autonomous infrastructure such as satellites, defense systems, power grids, and industrial robotics, where execution finality matters more than transaction ordering.

## 1. Introduction

Most secure systems answer the question:  
**“Who is allowed to issue this command?”**

XEQUES answers a different, more fundamental question:  
**“Did the system actually execute the command correctly?”**

Traditional approaches rely on logs, telemetry streams, or centralized attestation services. These mechanisms are fragile: logs can be altered, telemetry can be dropped, and centralized verifiers create single points of failure. Blockchains improve ordering and consensus but do not prove real-world execution.

As autonomous systems become more capable and more independent, the absence of cryptographic execution proof becomes a critical security gap.

XEQUES closes this gap by elevating **execution verification** to a Layer-1 concern. The protocol treats execution receipts—signed by the device itself—as first-class cryptographic objects. Verification does not require continuous connectivity, trusted servers, or global consensus.

## 2. Problem Statement

Existing security models suffer from three structural limitations:

1. **Authorization without execution proof**  
   Digital signatures prove that a command was authorized, not that it was executed.

2. **Centralized trust dependencies**  
   Execution verification often depends on trusted logging servers or monitoring systems.

3. **Inadequate lifetime guarantees**  
   Classical cryptography does not provide sufficient assurances for systems expected to operate for decades under quantum threat models.

As a result, auditors, regulators, and operators lack cryptographically sound evidence that autonomous systems behaved as intended—especially after incidents.

XEQUES addresses these limitations by introducing a protocol where execution produces cryptographic artifacts that can be independently verified long after the fact.

## 3. Core Concept: Proof-of-Command-Correctness (PoCC)

**Proof-of-Command-Correctness (PoCC)** is a cryptographic proof emitted by a device *after* it executes an authorized command.

A PoCC receipt binds together:

- The command payload  
- A monotonic execution sequence  
- The device identity  
- The execution result  
- A post-quantum digital signature  

Crucially, PoCC receipts cannot be produced *without execution*. They are generated by the same trusted execution context that performs the command, making forgery without device compromise infeasible.

PoCC receipts can be:
- Verified offline  
- Audited independently  
- Stored in append-only logs  
- Used as legal or operational evidence  

This shifts trust from *issuers* to *executors*.

## 4. Design Goals

XEQUES is guided by the following design principles:

1. **Execution-centric trust**  
   Execution, not authorization or ordering, is the primitive.

2. **Post-quantum security**  
   All cryptographic operations are designed to remain secure under quantum adversaries.

3. **Offline verifiability**  
   Receipts must be verifiable without network access.

4. **Minimal Layer-1 surface**  
   XEQUES avoids unnecessary complexity such as global consensus or token economics.

5. **Longevity**  
   Protocol artifacts must remain verifiable decades into the future.
