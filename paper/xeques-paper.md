## A Layer-1 Protocol for Verifiable Execution

## Abstract

We present XEQUES, a Layer-1 protocol where execution,
not authorization or consensus, is the cryptographic
finality primitive.

---

## 1. Introduction

Autonomous infrastructure demands execution guarantees.

---

## 2. Limitations of Existing Systems

Authorization does not imply execution.

---

## 3. XEQUES Design

Devices emit cryptographic execution receipts.

---

## 4. Security Analysis

We analyze replay resistance, forgery resistance,
and quantum safety.

---

## 5. Conclusion

XEQUES introduces execution as a first-class trust primitive.
