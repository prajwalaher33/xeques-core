## Abstract

We introduce XEQUES, a Layer-1 protocol that elevates execution
to a cryptographically verifiable primitive.
Unlike blockchains or authorization systems,
XEQUES proves that commands were actually executed.

---

## 1. Introduction

Autonomous infrastructure requires stronger guarantees
than authorization alone.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Existing systems cannot cryptographically prove execution.

---

## 3. Protocol Overview

XEQUES defines Proof-of-Command-Correctness (PoCC),
a device-generated execution receipt.

---

## 4. Security Analysis

We prove resistance to replay, forgery, and quantum adversaries.

---

## 5. Comparison

| System | Proves Execution |
|------|------------------|
| PKI | ❌ |
| Blockchains | ❌ |
| XEQUES | ✅ |

---

## 6. Conclusion

XEQUES redefines trust for autonomous systems.
